Code to replicate:

Korobilis, D. and Schröder, M.  (forthcoming).“Probabilistic Quantile Factor Analysis,” Journal of Business and Economic Statistics. 


There are four folders. The first two (Empirical_1 and Empirical_2) replicate the first two exercises that extract quantile factors from uncertainty and FCI data, respectively.

The second two folders replicate some of the numerous Monte Carlo exercises we have in the paper and online appendix. The one named _ELBO prints estimates accurately the lower bound of the variational Bayes algorithm in order to do factor selection. The folder with the extension _MAIN replicates the first Monte Carlo exercise where we compare our algorithm to the IQR algorithm using various flexible error distributions.
